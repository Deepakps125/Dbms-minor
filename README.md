# Academic Project: File Operations, Indexing, and Excel Access in Java  

## Project Overview  
This academic project addresses three distinct problems:  
1. **File Operations**: Managing files and directories programmatically.  
2. **File Indexing**: Creating an index for efficient file retrieval.  
3. **Accessing Excel Files**: Reading from and writing to Excel files using Java.  

## Features  
### 1. File Operations  
- Perform basic file management tasks: create, read, update, and delete.  
- Traverse directories and handle files systematically.  
- Manage file I/O operations with exception handling.  

### 2. File Indexing  
- Create an index for files in specified directories.  
- Enable fast searches by file attributes such as name, type, or modification date.  
- Store and manage index data for scalability.  

### 3. Accessing Excel Files  
- Read Excel files (.xlsx) using the Apache POI library.  
- Write and update Excel sheets programmatically.  
- Handle malformed or corrupt Excel files with error detection.  

## Setup Instructions  
### Prerequisites  
- Install Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.  
- Download and add the [Apache POI library](https://poi.apache.org/download.html) to your project.  

### Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository_url>  
   ```  
2. Add the Apache POI dependencies to your project. If you're using Maven, include this in your `pom.xml`:  
   ```xml  
   <dependency>  
       <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>  
       <artifactId>poi-ooxml</artifactId>  
       <version>5.2.3</version>  
   </dependency>  
   ```  

## Usage  
### File Operations  
Run the file operations module to perform basic tasks like file creation and deletion:  
```java  
java FileOperations  
```  

### File Indexing  
Generate and manage a file index using the indexing module:  
```java  
java FileIndexing  
```  

### Accessing Excel Files  
Perform read/write operations on Excel files with the Excel access module:  
```java  
java ExcelAccess  
```  

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Java**: Programming language.  
- **Apache POI**: Library for handling Excel file operations.
