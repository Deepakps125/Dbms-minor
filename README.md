# Academic Project: File Operations, Indexing, and Excel Access  

## Project Overview  
This academic project tackles three core problems:  
1. **File Operations**: Efficient handling and manipulation of file systems.  
2. **File Indexing**: Creating and managing an index for rapid file retrieval.  
3. **Accessing Excel Files**: Reading and writing data to Excel files for analysis.  

## Features  
### 1. File Operations  
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for files.  
- Directory traversal and management.  
- File format validation and error handling.  

### 2. File Indexing  
- Index creation for files in specified directories.  
- Search capabilities based on file metadata (e.g., name, type, date modified).  
- Efficient retrieval mechanisms for large datasets.  

### 3. Accessing Excel Files  
- Read data from Excel files (.xlsx format).  
- Write and update Excel sheets programmatically.  
- Data validation and error handling for malformed files.  

## Setup Instructions  
1. Clone this repository to your local system.  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository_url>  
   ```  
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:  
  - `pandas` (for Excel file operations)  
  - `openpyxl` (for working with `.xlsx` files)  
  - Additional libraries specified in `requirements.txt`  

## Usage  
### File Operations  
Run the file operations module to interact with files in a specified directory:  
```bash  
python file_operations.py  
```  

### File Indexing  
Generate and use a file index by running:  
```bash  
python file_indexing.py  
```  

### Accessing Excel Files  
Perform read/write operations on Excel files:  
```bash  
python excel_access.py  
```
